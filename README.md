CSS Regions basic feature testing
=================================
                                                                                                         
This set of unit tests helps determine the level of support for CSS Regions in a Webkit-powered browser.

It is not meant to be a full test suite or to have a broad code coverage. For that please refer to the [CSS Regions WebKit Layout Tests](http://trac.webkit.org/browser/trunk/LayoutTests/fast/regions)
    
How to use
----------
Open the index.html in your WebKit-powered browser.                        

A passing test means that the feature is supported by the browser.
A failing test means that the feature is not yet supported by the browser.
